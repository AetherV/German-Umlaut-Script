# German Umlaut Script



##What is this?
This project aims to improve the quality of life of people who are using a QWERTY keyboard but require the features of a German QWERTZ keyboard, specifically:

* ä
* ö
* ü
* ß
* „

It seeks to improve ck's original script from the [AHK forums](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/515-german-umlaute-convenience-script/). Probably the most notable addition is adding `„`, which could not be found in the old script
